# Cat Facts
A website that displays a random cat fact and image.

# How it works
On load, the user's browser sends a request to [Cat Facts API]([https://www.ipify.org/](https://catfact.ninja/)). The API has entries with spelling and errors, this is for entertainment use only.
Then, the code generates a random number and selects one of 20 images, and loads credits.
The Montserrat font is from [fonts.upset.dev](https://upset.dev/fonts). The images are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).
